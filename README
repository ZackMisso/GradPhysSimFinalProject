Final Report is in report.pdf

Instructions on How to Run:

qmake && make clean && make && ./goo

What You Should See:

There are 3 working views:
    Single Strand Example: displays a single strand moving due to gravity and the restoring force
    Interpolation Example: simulates two hair strands under gravity and interpolates other hair strands to fit between
    Bundle Example: simulates a bundle of hair which is just two hair strands with the same start position with interpolated hair strands in between
    Head Example: not implemented by the time of submission
    Sphere Example: not implemented by the time of submission

You can change the stiffness (EI) of the hair which damps the restoring force
You can change the amount of gravity
You can change the time step
You can change the Newtons tolerance and Newtons iterations
The other values that are available to be changed do not have any effect
You can have the hair strands render out the individual segments by checking the show segments box

This submission contains all of the mathematics for our hair simulations, however, we are still working on our examples, rendering code, and a
baking system to make the simulation run quickly for the final demonstration on May 15th.

All the hair strands in our examples for this submission contain two segments of equal length and each segment is made of 100 sub segments. Our code supports
hair strands of various lengths and segments of various lengths. But those will be implemented in time for the final demonstration.
