Our Project: Psuedo-Realistic Hair Simulation

What we claimed to have finished:

Solve the equations of motion for hair segments
Implement Hair Reconstruction from the curvatures of hair segments
Implement the equations of motion

What we did:

We worked towards implementing a hair simulation based off of the Super Helices paper.
The paper claimed to represent hair as a collection of super helic segments.
Every segment can have a different, but constant, curvature. This allows a hair sim
to represent the DoF of a system of hair strands as the curvatures of the individual
segments of hair. A single strand of hair can have multiple segments so the total
number of DoFs is 3n where n is the number of segments.

We derived the equations of motion of hair segments in terms of their curvatures.
Those calculations are in the pdf attached to this submission.

We implemented reconstruction of a hair strand based off of the curvatures of its
segments.

We implemented a visual representation of our reconstruction and hair dynamics. We
have not yet implemented the equations of motion in code. The hair strand that can
be seen in the simulation contains two segments. Each segment's curvatures are
varied with respect to time based on arbitrary functions of our choosing for demo
purposes.

Every time step the curvatures are updated and the hair strand is reconstructed.

To compile and run the code: qmake && make clean && make && ./goo
